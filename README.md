# Personnel Setup

1. Create an account on [Cloud 9](http://c9.io)
2. Create a new workspace that is a clone of this repository
3. Using the terminal, run `. install.sh $IP $C9_USER`
4. After installation completes, browse to https://personnel-[your c9 username].c9.io/repositories/forums
5. On the Vanilla installer, change the **Database Host** from **localhost** to **0.0.0.0** and fill in an admin email, username, and password
6. It may bring you back to the installer screen afterwards, but if there's no error, you're good to go. Navigate to /repositories/forums again to verify you're logged in
7. Navigate to /repositories/personnel-app/dist to view the application
